Description:
This tool is designed to monitor changes in files by calculating and comparing their hash values over time. It helps detect unauthorized modifications, corruption, or tampering by verifying file integrity.

âœ… Key Features:
Initial Hashing: Calculates and stores hash values (e.g., SHA-256) for target files.

Change Detection: Re-checks and compares current hashes with the stored ones.

Alerts on Change: Notifies the user if a file has been added, modified, or deleted.

Flexible Monitoring: Supports monitoring of single files, directories, or file types.

Logging: Records all detected changes with timestamps for audit purposes.

ðŸ“¦ Use Cases:
Detecting unauthorized file changes (security).

Monitoring critical config or system files.

Validating integrity after updates or deployments.
